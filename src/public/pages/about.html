<h1>About QA Ticks and Crosses</h1>
<p>
  We used to have the ability in WebEx Training for learners to send us ticks, crosses and other emojis.
  In WebEx Meetings no such feature exists. This web app aims to fill that gap.
</p>
<h2>Support</h2>
<p>
  This application has been developed by Andrew Burgess, a ex-tutor at QA, in his spare time.
  It is not supported by Andrew, QA support desk, or any other function within QA. If something goes wrong, 
  please post a message in the tutor chat on MS Teams and hopefully someone will be able to help.
  Suggestions for improvements are always welcome.
